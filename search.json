    "text": "Why?\nThere’s this weird phenomenon where people write data programming code as if they hate themselves. Many of them are academic or quant types who seem to have some complex about being “bad at coding”. Armchair psychology aside, lots of clever folk keep doing really dumb stuff with Pandas, and at some point you have to wonder if the Pandas API is too difficult for its users.\nAt the very least, articles like Minimally Sufficient Pandas make a compelling case for Pandas having too much going on.\nHaving used Pandas a lot, I think Polars is more intuitive and does a better job of having One Obvious Way to do stuff. It’s also much faster at most things, even when you do Pandas the right way.\nHopefully this work shows you how, why and when to prefer Polars."

To quote Modern Pandas:\n\nThe complexity of pandas’ indexing is a microcosm for the complexity of the pandas API in general. There’s a reason for the complexity (well, most of it), but that’s not much consolation while you’re learning. Still, all of these ways of indexing really are useful enough to justify their inclusion in the library.\n\nIt’s true that Pandas indexing is quite useful, but it’s also true that everyone always forgets how do to anything non-trivial with it. The benefits of being able to put df.loc[pd.IndexSlice[:, 'B0':'B1'], :]] in your code base are somewhat dubious.\nPolars avoids this complexity by simply not having an index. It just has ordinary methods like .select, .filter and .head for accessing a subset of rows or columns."

If you pass around expressions, this pattern is easy.\n\nPolars is fast and convenient for doing the same thing to multiple columns. We can pass a list of columns to pl.col and then call a method on that pl.col as if it were one column. When the expression gets executed it will be parallelized by Polars.\nMeanwhile in Pandas we have to loop through the columns to create a dictionary of kwargs for .assign. This is not parallelized. (We could use .apply with axis=0 instead but this would still take place sequentially and isn’t any easier to read, in my opinion).\nCalling .str.split in Polars creates a column where every element is a list. This kind of data is annoying in Pandas because it’s slow and awkward to work with - notice how the most convenient way to get the first element of a list column in Pandas is to call .str[0], even though this is a list, not a string 🤔\nI’m not sure if that’s even supposed to work. In contrast, Polars actually has first class support for list columns, and they are fast as long as they don’t have mixed types.\n\n\nPolarsPandas\n\n\n\ndef time_col_pl(col: str) -> pl.Expr:\n    col_expr = pl.col(col)\n    return (\n        pl.when(col_expr == \"2400\")\n        .then(\"0000\")\n        .otherwise(col_expr)\n        .str.strptime(pl.Time, \"%H%M\", strict=True)\n        .alias(col)\n    )\n\n\ndef time_to_datetime_pl(columns: list[str]) -> list[pl.Expr]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combine all time items into datetimes.\n\n    2014-01-01,0914 -> 2014-01-01 09:14:00\n    \"\"\"\n    date_val = pl.col(\"FlightDate\").dt.epoch(\"us\")\n    return [\n        (date_val + time_col_pl(col).to_physical() // 1000)\n        .cast(pl.Datetime)\n        .alias(col)\n        for col in columns\n    ]\n\n\n\n\ndef time_col_pd(col: str, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    timepart = df[col].replace(\"2400\", \"0000\")\n    return pd.to_datetime(df[\"FlightDate\"] + ' ' +\n                            timepart.str.slice(0, 2) + ':' +\n                            timepart.str.slice(2, 4),\n                            errors='coerce')\n\ndef time_to_datetime_pd(df: pd.DataFrame, columns: list[str]) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    '''\n    Combine all time items into datetimes.\n\n    2014-01-01,0914 -> 2014-01-01 09:14:00\n    '''\n    return df.assign(**{col: time_col_pd(col, df) for col in columns})\n\n\n\n\nThe Pandas version concatenates the date and time strings then parses the datetime string. We could do the same in Polars but I wanted to show you the pl.Date and pl.Time dtypes, which Pandas lacks.

This is why pl.scan_csv itself doesn’t have a parameter for choosing a subset of columns to read.\nPolars does have a .pipe method, but we don’t use it in this case since it’s easier to work with expressions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe .with_columns method is for adding new columns or overwriting existing ones. But .select can also do those things, so you may be wondering: what’s the difference?\nBasically the .with_columns method is just convenient for when you don’t want to reselect all the columns you’re not modifying."

In Pandas we use .groupby with the pd.Grouper helper.\nInstead of .rolling(n).sum(), Polars has .rolling_sum(n).\nIf you see Pandas code using .unstack, the corresponding Polars code probably needs .pivot.\nIn Polars, .value_counts returns a pl.Struct column containing the value and the value count. In Pandas it returns a series where the elements are the value counts and the index contains the values themselves.\nIn Polars we need to select all the UInt32 cols at one point using pl.col(pl.UInt32). In Pandas, the way .rolling works means we don’t need to select these cols explicitly, but if we did it would look like df.select_dtypes(\"uint32\").\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Planes With Multiple Daily Flights\nNow let’s see if planes with multiple flights per day tend to get delayed as the day goes on:\n\nPolarsPandas\n\n\n\nflights_pl = (\n    df_pl.select(\n        pl.col([\n            \"FlightDate\",\n            \"Tail_Number\",\n            \"DepTime\",\n            \"DepDelay\"\n        ])\n    )\n    .drop_nulls()\n    .sort(\"DepTime\")\n    .filter(pl.col(\"DepDelay\") < 500)\n    .with_column(\n        pl.col(\"DepTime\")\n        .rank()\n        .over([\"FlightDate\", \"Tail_Number\"])\n        .alias(\"turn\")\n    )\n)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"turn\", y=\"DepDelay\", data=flights_pl.to_pandas(), ax=ax)\nax.set_ylim(-50, 50)\n\n(-50.0, 50.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflights_pd = (\n    df_pd[[\n        \"FlightDate\",\n        \"Tail_Number\",\n        \"DepTime\",\n        \"DepDelay\"\n    ]]\n    .dropna()\n    .sort_values('DepTime')\n    .loc[lambda x: x[\"DepDelay\"] < 500]\n    .assign(turn = lambda x:\n        x.groupby([\"FlightDate\", \"Tail_Number\"])\n        [\"DepTime\"].transform('rank')\n        .astype(int)\n    )\n)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"turn\", y=\"DepDelay\", data=flights_pd, ax=ax)\nax.set_ylim(-50, 50)\n\n(-50.0, 50.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne new thing here: window functions.

This likely won’t speed things up but will use less memory.\nUse efficient storage (if you’re dumping stuff in files, Parquet is a good choice).\nUse categoricals for recurring strings (but note that it may not be worth it if there’s not much repetition).\nOnly select the columns you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf your colleagues are happy with CSVs and can’t be convinced to use something else, tell them that the Modern Polars book says they should feel bad.\n\n\nThese are basically the same rules you’d follow when using Pandas, except for the one about the lazy API.

Only the latter is nullable. On the other hand, Polars has just one unsigned 32-bit integer type, and it’s nullable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPolars expressions have a shrink_dtype method that can be more convenient than manually specifying the dtypes yourself. It’s not magic though, and it has to spend time finding the min and max of the column.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Data cleaning\nThere’s not much that you haven’t seen here already, so we won’t explain the code line by line.

    "text": "4.3 Pivot and Melt\nI recently came across someone who was doing advanced quantitative research in Python but had never heard of the Pandas .pivot method. I shudder to imagine the code he must have written in the absence of this knowledge, so here’s a simple explanation of pivoting and melting, lest anyone else suffer in ignorance. If you already know what pivot and melt are, feel free to scroll past this bit.\n\n4.3.1 Pivot\nSuppose you have a dataframe that looks like this:\n\n\nCode\nfrom datetime import date\nprices = pl.DataFrame({\n    \"date\": [*[date(2020, 1, 1)]*4, *[date(2020, 1, 2)]*4, *[date(2020, 1, 3)]*4],\n    \"ticker\": [*[\"AAPL\", \"TSLA\", \"MSFT\", \"NFLX\"]*3],\n    \"price\": [100, 200, 300, 400, 110, 220, 330, 420, 105, 210, 315, 440],\n})\nprices\n\n\n\n\n\nshape: (12, 3)\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\nticker\n\n\nprice\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\nstr\n\n\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-01\n\n\n\"AAPL\"\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-01\n\n\n\"TSLA\"\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-03\n\n\n\"MSFT\"\n\n\n315\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-03\n\n\n\"NFLX\"\n\n\n440\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both Polars and Pandas you can call df.pivot(index=\"date\", values=\"price\", columns=\"ticker\") to get a dataframe that looks like this:\n\n\nCode\npivoted = prices.pivot(index=\"date\", values=\"price\", columns=\"ticker\")\npivoted\n\n\n\n\n\nshape: (3, 5)\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\nAAPL\n\n\nTSLA\n\n\nMSFT\n\n\nNFLX\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-01\n\n\n100\n\n\n200\n\n\n300\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-02\n\n\n110\n\n\n220\n\n\n330\n\n\n420\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-03\n\n\n105\n\n\n210\n\n\n315\n\n\n440\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, .pivot creates a dataframe where the columns are the unique labels from one column (“ticker”), alongside the index column (“date”). The values for the non-index columns are taken from the corresponding rows of the values column (“price”).\nIf our dataframe had multiple prices for the same ticker on the same date, we would use the aggregate_fn parameter of the .pivot method, e.g.: prices.pivot(..., aggregate_fn=\"mean\"). Pivoting with an aggregate function gives us similar behaviour to what Excel calls “pivot tables”.\n\n\n4.3.2 Melt\nMelt is the inverse of pivot. While pivot takes us from long data to wide data, melt goes from wide to long. If we call .melt(id_vars=\"date\", value_name=\"price\") on our pivoted dataframe we get our original dataframe back:\n\n\nCode\npivoted.melt(id_vars=\"date\", value_name=\"price\")\n\n\n\n\n\nshape: (12, 3)\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\nvariable\n\n\nprice\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\nstr\n\n\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-01\n\n\n\"AAPL\"\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-02\n\n\n\"AAPL\"\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-02\n\n\n\"NFLX\"\n\n\n420\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-03\n\n\n\"NFLX\"\n\n\n440"

You can of course use regular .groupby with a time column, but it won’t be as powerful because it doesn’t understand time like resampling methods do.\nThere are two kinds of resampling: downsampling and upsampling.\n\n5.3.1 Downsampling\nDownsampling moves from a higher time frequency to a lower time frequency. This requires some aggregation or subsetting, since we’re reducing the number of rows in our data.\nIn Polars we use the .groupby_dynamic method for downsampling (we also use groupby_dynamic when we want to combine resampling with regular groupby logic).\n\nPolarsPandas\n\n\n\n(\n    ohlcv_pl\n    .groupby_dynamic(\"time\", every=\"5d\")\n    .agg(pl.col(pl.Float64).mean())\n)\n\n\n\n\nshape: (74, 6)\n\n\n\n\ntime\n\n\nopen\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nlow\n\n\nclose\n\n\nvolume\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021-01-01\n\n\n31084.316\n\n\n33127.622\n\n\n29512.818\n\n\n32089.662\n\n\n112416.84957\n\n\n\n\n2021-01-06\n\n\n38165.31\n\n\n40396.842\n\n\n35983.822\n\n\n39004.538\n\n\n118750.076685\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-27\n\n\n48521.24\n\n\n49475.878\n\n\n47087.4\n\n\n47609.528\n\n\n35886.94371\n\n\n\n\n2022-01-01\n\n\n46216.93\n\n\n47954.63\n\n\n46208.37\n\n\n47722.65\n\n\n19604.46325\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nohlcv_pd.resample(\"5d\").mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      open\n      high\n      low\n      close\n      volume\n    \n    \n      time\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      2021-01-01\n      31084.316\n      33127.622\n      29512.818\n      32089.662\n      112416.849570\n    \n    \n      2021-01-06\n      38165.310\n      40396.842\n      35983.822\n      39004.538\n      118750.076685\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      2021-12-27\n      48521.240\n      49475.878\n      47087.400\n      47609.528\n      35886.943710\n    \n    \n      2022-01-01\n      46216.930\n      47954.630\n      46208.370\n      47722.650\n      19604.463250\n    \n  \n\n74 rows × 5 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResampling and performing multiple aggregations to each column:\n\nPolarsPandas\n\n\n\nohlcv_pl.groupby_dynamic(\"time\", every=\"1w\").agg(\n    [\n        pl.col(pl.Float64).mean().suffix(\"_mean\"),\n        pl.col(pl.Float64).sum().suffix(\"_sum\")\n    ]\n)\n\n\n\n\nshape: (53, 11)\n\n\n\n\ntime\n\n\nopen_mean\n\n\nhigh_mean\n\n\nlow_mean\n\n\nclose_mean\n\n\nvolume_mean\n\n\nopen_sum\n\n\nhigh_sum\n\n\nlow_sum\n\n\nclose_sum\n\n\nvolume_sum\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021-01-01\n\n\n32305.781429\n\n\n34706.045714\n\n\n31021.727143\n\n\n33807.135714\n\n\n117435.5928\n\n\n226140.47\n\n\n242942.32\n\n\n217152.09\n\n\n236649.95\n\n\n822049.149598\n\n\n\n\n2021-01-08\n\n\n37869.797143\n\n\n39646.105714\n\n\n34623.334286\n\n\n37827.52\n\n\n135188.296617\n\n\n265088.58\n\n\n277522.74\n\n\n242363.34\n\n\n264792.64\n\n\n946318.076319\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-24\n\n\n49649.114286\n\n\n50439.622857\n\n\n48528.25\n\n\n49117.98\n\n\n31126.709793\n\n\n347543.8\n\n\n353077.36\n\n\n339697.75\n\n\n343825.86\n\n\n217886.96855\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-31\n\n\n46668.905\n\n\n48251.445\n\n\n45943.185\n\n\n46969.79\n\n\n27271.230605\n\n\n93337.81\n\n\n96502.89\n\n\n91886.37\n\n\n93939.58\n\n\n54542.46121\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nohlcv_pd.resample(\"W\").agg(['mean', 'sum'])\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      open\n      high\n      low\n      close\n      volume\n    \n    \n      \n      mean\n      sum\n      mean\n      sum\n      mean\n      sum\n      mean\n      sum\n      mean\n      sum\n    \n    \n      time\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      2021-01-03\n      30143.926667\n      90431.78\n      32559.370000\n      97678.11\n      29844.696667\n      89534.09\n      31503.356667\n      94510.07\n      101711.455041\n      305134.365123\n    \n    \n      2021-01-10\n      36545.192857\n      255816.35\n      38563.458571\n      269944.21\n      33992.730000\n      237949.11\n      37280.132857\n      260960.93\n      121528.609450\n      850700.266152\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      2021-12-26\n      49018.521429\n      343129.65\n      50294.841429\n      352063.89\n      48352.841429\n      338469.89\n      49603.737143\n      347226.16\n      29878.489421\n      209149.425950\n    \n    \n      2022-01-02\n      48137.188333\n      288823.13\n      49222.336667\n      295334.02\n      46940.895000\n      281645.37\n      47628.381667\n      285770.29\n      33173.196967\n      199039.181800\n    \n  \n\n53 rows × 10 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Upsampling\nUpsampling moves in the opposite direction, from low-frequency data to high frequency data.

This is partly because most of the code is written in Rust, and calling Rust in other languages works much better than calling Python.\nThe lead dev is very productive and quick to fix bugs."

They were fixed quickly and tests were added to make sure they don’t happen again, but it all makes me feel somewhat uneasy. It’s not like Pandas hasn’t gone through a whole insectarium of bugs, but Polars probably has more right now due to being newer.\n\n\nIf it ain’t broke, don’t fix it\nSuppose you have a bunch of important stuff in another library that works fine, even if it’s a bit slow. Maybe it doesn’t have good tests. Switching library is tricky and may not be worth it here. Even if Polars is bug-free, various default behaviours might differ from your expectations.\n\n\nAPI stability\nSince Polars is young and has not made a 1.0 release yet, the API is subject to breaking changes. Indeed, it has quite a few features that are explicitly labelled as experimental."
